# kendo.data.GanttDependency

The `kendo.data.GanttDependency` class represents a data item from the [`kendo.data.GanttDependencyDataSource`](/api/framework/ganttdependencydatasource). Inherits from [`kendo.data.Model`](/api/framework/model).

## Configuration

### id `String|Number|Object`

The mandatory unique identifier of the dependency.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set or specify a unique identifier for task dependencies within a Gantt chart to enable precise referencing, linking, tracking, and updating of dependency relationships. This identifier helps in managing connections between tasks, synchronizing dependency data, performing lookups, configuring dependencies, and ensuring consistency within project timelines or scheduling tools. Use a mandatory unique key to control and identify each dependency record, support data synchronization, maintain integrity during task updates, and facilitate automatic changes or queries involving task links and dependency management.
</div>

#### Example - set the identifier of a dependency

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
    </script>

### predecessorId `String|Number|Object`

The  mandatory `id` of the predecessor task.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Specify or set the identifier of the task that must be completed before the current task starts, establish task dependency links, control predecessor relationships, configure required parent task IDs, link dependent tasks by referencing the unique task identifier, enforce task scheduling order by defining which task precedes another, enable cascading task connections based on prior task completion, assign or configure the mandatory predecessor task ID to create dependency chains, manage project timelines by linking tasks through predecessor references, and ensure task sequences respect project workflow by setting valid preceding task identifiers.
</div>

#### Example - set the predecessorId of a dependency

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
    </script>

### successorId `String|Number|Object`

The  mandatory `id` of the successor task.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set or specify the identifier for a task that follows another in a sequence, enabling the configuration of task dependencies, linking predecessor and successor tasks, establishing order and relationships between tasks, connecting dependent tasks by their unique IDs, and illustrating workflow progression in project scheduling and timeline management.
</div>

#### Example - set the successorId of a dependency

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
    </script>

### type `String|Number|Object`

The type of the dependency. The type is a value between 0 and 3, representing the four different dependency types:

* `0` - Finish-Finish
* `1` - Finish-Start
* `2` - Start-Finish
* `3` - Start-Start


<div class="meta-api-description">
Specify or modify the relationship type between tasks in a project timeline to control how one task depends on another, defining task sequencing or dependencies such as finish-to-finish, finish-to-start, start-to-finish, or start-to-start using numeric or coded values. This setting influences order, scheduling constraints, and task coordination by enabling developers to set, configure, or adjust predecessor and successor links, manage task dependencies, enforce project flow rules, and customize the timing interactions between tasks in Gantt charts for project management or workflow visualization.
</div>

#### Example - set the type of a dependency

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
    </script>

## Fields

### id `String|Number|Object`

The unique identifier of the dependency.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Identify, reference, or manipulate a unique dependency link between tasks in a Gantt chart by using its distinct identifier, enabling you to search for, update, compare, delete, or manage specific task dependencies efficiently within project scheduling data. This unique dependency ID supports precise lookup of relationships connecting tasks, facilitating control over task dependencies, relation tracking, and dependency management within project timelines and scheduling tools.
</div>

#### Example - set the dependency id

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
	/* The result can be observed in the DevTools(F12) console of the browser. */
    console.log(dependency.id); // outputs "1"
    </script>

### predecessorId `String|Number|Object`

The `id` of the predecessor task.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Identify, retrieve, or assign the unique identifier of a preceding task in task dependency links within Gantt charts, enabling control over task relationships, sequence management, dependency tracking, and task ordering by referencing the specific ID of the task that must be completed first or that triggers dependent tasks, useful for configuring task workflows, establishing predecessor connections, managing project timelines, and controlling task dependencies through their IDs after initialization.
</div>

#### Example - get the dependency predecessorId field

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
	/* The result can be observed in the DevTools(F12) console of the browser. */
    console.log(dependency.predecessorId); // outputs "1"
    </script>

### successorId `String|Number|Object`

The `id` of the successor task.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set, get, or manage the identifier linking a task to its subsequent dependent task in project scheduling, enabling control over task sequences, successor relationships, dependency chains, task order updates, and the mapping of follow-up tasks by their unique ids. This field connects predecessor and successor tasks, supports task dependency creation, modification, and evaluation workflows, and is essential for defining which task comes next within Gantt chart timelines or dependency records. Access and manipulate task linkage references to configure task sequences, schedule dependencies, or update follow-on task identifiers in project management applications.
</div>

#### Example - get the dependency successorId field

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
	/* The result can be observed in the DevTools(F12) console of the browser. */
    console.log(dependency.successorId); // outputs "2"
    </script>

### type `String|Number|Object`

The type of the dependency. The type is a value between 0 and 3, representing the four different dependency types:

* `0` - Finish-Finish
* `1` - Finish-Start
* `2` - Start-Finish
* `3` - Start-Start


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure or retrieve the kind of link or dependency connecting two tasks in a project timeline, specifying the relational type between predecessor and successor tasks such as finish-to-start, start-to-start, finish-to-finish, or start-to-finish dependencies. Enable setting or reading these relationship types using numeric codes or identifiers that represent how tasks are sequenced, coordinated, or constrained with each other in a Gantt chart or project schedule. Control task dependencies by defining which task must finish or start before another begins or ends, supporting dependency types for scheduling order, task linkage, task constraints, and workflow management between related project activities.
</div>

#### Example - get the dependency type

    <script>
    var dependency = new kendo.data.GanttDependency({
        id: 1,
        predecessorId: 1,
        successorId: 2,
        type: 0
    });
	/* The result can be observed in the DevTools(F12) console of the browser. */
    console.log(dependency.type); // outputs "0"
    </script>
