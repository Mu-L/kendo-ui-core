# kendo.data.SchedulerEvent

The `kendo.data.SchedulerEvent` class represents a data item from the [kendo.data.SchedulerDataSource](/api/framework/schedulerdatasource). Inherits from [kendo.data.Model](/api/framework/model).



## Configuration

### description `String` *(default: "")*

The optional event description.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Add or set detailed text notes, descriptions, agendas, contextual information, or annotations for scheduling events to enhance event clarity, improve searchability, support filtering, tooltips, display in editors, provide extra metadata, enable exporting with richer content, and facilitate quick identification or retrieval of events based on descriptive text, keywords, or human-readable summaries.
</div>

#### Example - set the description of an event

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        title: "Lunch",
        start: new Date("2013/4/4 12:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/4/4 13:00"),
        description: "Lunch with Harry and Steve"
    });
    </script>

### end `Date`

The date at which the scheduler event ends. The `end` date is mandatory.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Specify or configure the event's finishing time, end date, or completion timestamp to define when the scheduled activity or appointment concludes, enabling accurate calculation of duration, rendering of time slots, setting of event boundaries, and proper display within calendars or scheduling interfaces. This finishing point is essential for managing event timing, duration computation, slot allocation, end time adjustments, and handling scheduling periods, ensuring precise control over event lifecycles, including start-to-end intervals and time-based planning.
</div>

#### Example - set the end date of an event

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        title: "Lunch",
        start: new Date("2013/4/4 12:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/4/4 13:00")
    });
    </script>

### endTimezone `String` *(default: undefined)*

The timezone of the `end` date. If not specified the [timezone](/api/javascript/ui/scheduler/configuration/timezone) will be used.

The complete list of the supported timezones is available in the [List of IANA time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IANA_time_zones) Wikipedia page.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set or configure the timezone for the ending time of scheduled events to ensure accurate time display and conversion across different regions, handle scenarios where event end times cross multiple timezones, override default timezone settings for event conclusions, specify any standard IANA timezone identifier for precise localization, control how event ending moments are interpreted and rendered in calendar or scheduling applications, manage timezone offsets for event finish times, adapt event end timestamps for users in diverse geographic areas, support correct time calculations when events stretch across global time boundaries, and enable fine-tuning of event completion times for better scheduling accuracy and clarity.
</div>

#### Example - set the end timezone of an event

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        title: "Lunch",
        start: new Date("2013/4/4 12:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/4/4 13:00"),
        endTimezone: "Europe/Sofia"
    });
    </script>

### id `String|Number|Object`

The mandatory unique identifier of the event.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Assign a unique identifier to each scheduled event to enable precise referencing, retrieval, updating, or deletion of specific tasks while ensuring no duplicate events occur within the scheduling system; configure and control event identities to manage, track, or manipulate individual scheduler entries reliably through distinct, mandatory IDs that prevent conflicts and facilitate event management workflows.
</div>

#### Example - set the identifier of an event

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        title: "Lunch",
        start: new Date("2013/4/4 12:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/4/4 13:00")
    });
    </script>

### isAllDay `Boolean` *(default: false)*

If set to `true` the event is "all day". By default events are not all day.

> **Important**: When `isAllDay` is set to `true` the `start` and `end` fields must be set to the same date.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure events to span an entire day by enabling all-day scheduling, setting appointments or calendar entries to occupy the full 24-hour period without specific start or end times. Control or mark events as whole-day occurrences, ensuring that the date range covers a single day rather than specific hours, useful for vacations, holidays, or full-day tasks. Set or toggle boolean flags to indicate all-day status, affecting how events display and interact with time ranges. Manage calendar entries to appear as all-day without time increments, handling cases where start and end times align on the same date to signal full-day duration. Adjust scheduling logic for events that require no hourly detail but need to block out a full calendar day.
</div>

#### Example - create all day event

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        title: "Birthday",
        start: new Date("2013/4/4 00:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/4/4 00:00"),
        isAllDay: true
    });
    /* The result can be observed in the DevTools(F12) console of the browser. */
    console.log(event.isAllDay); // outputs "true"
    </script>

### recurrenceException `String` *(default: undefined)*

The recurrence exceptions. A list of comma separated dates formatted using the `yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ` format string.

> **Important**: The dates should be encoded in UTC.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Exclude or skip specific instances from a repeating or recurring calendar event by defining exception dates in a standardized UTC timestamp format. Control which occurrences are omitted from a series by setting a list of date-time strings in the international ISO-like format for precise exclusion of single or multiple events. Customize and manage exceptions to repetitive schedules by specifying one or more exact occurrence dates to be ignored, enabling refined control over which repeated events appear or do not show up in a scheduling or calendar application. Use comma-separated date parameters formatted as year-month-day and time in coordinated universal time (UTC) to precisely configure event recurrence exceptions and prevent certain repetitions.
</div>

#### Example - set recurrence exceptions

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        start: new Date("2013/9/2 12:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/9/2 12:30"),
        title: "Lunch",
        recurrenceRule: "FREQ=DAILY",
        recurrenceException: new Date("2013/9/3 12:00").toISOString()
    });
    var exception =  new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 2,
        start: new Date("2013/9/3 12:30"),
        end: new Date("2013/9/3 13:00"),
        title: "Lunch",
        recurrenceId: 1
    });
    </script>

### recurrenceId `String|Number|Object` *(default: undefined)*

The `id` of the recurrence parent event. Required for events that are recurrence exceptions.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Identify or reference the original recurring event when managing exceptions in a repeating schedule by linking an exception instance to its parent event using a unique identifier, enabling developer control over modifications, updates, or overrides of specific occurrences within a recurring series, configuring exception relationships, tracking changes to repeated events, and ensuring correct event correlation in calendar scheduling or event management systems.
</div>

#### Example - set recurrence exceptions

    <script>
    var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 1,
        start: new Date("2013/9/2 12:00"),
        end: new Date("2013/9/2 12:30"),
        title: "Lunch",
        recurrenceRule: "FREQ=DAILY",
        recurrenceException: new Date("2013/9/3 12:00").toISOString()
    });
    var exception =  new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
        id: 2,
        start: new Date("2013/9/3 12:30"),

        title: "Lunch",
        recurrenceId: 1
    });
    </script>

### recurrenceRule `String` *(default: undefined)*

The recurrence rule describing the recurring pattern of the event. The format follows the [iCal specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545). You can find the recurrenceRule information under [section 3.3.10](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.3.10).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set up repeating event schedules by configuring recurrence patterns using standard iCalendar RRULE strings compliant with RFC 5545, enabling control over daily, weekly, monthly, or custom repeating intervals, frequencies, and exceptions within the calendar events. Support for defining complex repeating rules like every nth day, specific weekdays, end dates, counts, or infinite recurrences, useful for automating event repetition without manual entry. Ideal for developers needing to enable, customize, and manage event recurrence systematically using widely supported recurrence syntax for scheduling, calendar integrations, and time-based automation workflows.
</div>

#### Example - set the recurrence rule
    <script>

<div class="meta-api-description">
Check if a scheduled event spans multiple days, lasts 24 hours or more, or extends beyond a single day by using methods to detect multi-day durations; determine event length to apply conditional logic for rendering extended event styles, headers, multi-day labels, or scheduling adjustments based on whether an event is full-day or covers consecutive days, useful for filtering, displaying, or managing overlapping events and planning calendar views that require distinguishing between single-day and multi-day occurrences.
</div>

#### Returns

`Boolean` return `true` if event is equal to or longer then 24 hours.

#### Example - check whether an event is a multi-day event

    <script>
        var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
            id: 1,
            title: "Task1",

        console.log(event.isMultiDay()); //logs 'true'
    </script>

### isException

Checks whether the event is a recurrence exception.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Check if a calendar or scheduler event is an exception to a recurring series by detecting whether it is an edited, modified, skipped, or deleted occurrence that deviates from its original recurrence pattern. This helps identify altered or overridden instances within repeating events for filtering, conditional rendering, special handling, synchronization, exporting, or skipping specific dates that break from the main schedule. Determine if events break the recurrence rule, represent changes to repeating occurrences, or need unique processing compared to regular recurring entries by using methods to evaluate exception status, override states, or recurrence discrepancies, returning a true or false result.
</div>

#### Returns

`Boolean` return `true` if event is a recurrence exception.

#### Example - check whether an event is an exception

    <script>
        var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
            id: 2,
            recurrenceId: 1, //id of the recurrence head event
            title: "Task1",

    </script>

### isOccurrence

Checks whether the event is an occurrence part of a recurring series.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Determine whether an event instance belongs to a single occurrence within a recurring pattern or if it represents a master event or standalone item by checking its recurrence status, useful for distinguishing individual repeated appointments from full series in scheduling, filtering events based on repetition, managing edits or deletions of specific occurrences versus entire recurring sets, identifying recurrence exceptions, controlling display or logic for occurrences versus series masters, verifying event repetition state, and handling recurring event elements programmatically across scheduling applications.
</div>

#### Returns

`Boolean` return `true` if event is an occurrence.

#### Example - check whether an event is an occurrence

    <script>
        var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
            id: 0, //event has a default id
            recurrenceId: 1, //id of the recurrence head event
            title: "Task1",
            start: new Date("2013/4/4"),
            end: new Date("2013/4/4")

        console.log(event.isOccurrence()); //logs 'true'
    </script>

### isRecurring

Checks whether the event is part of a recurring series.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Check if a scheduled event repeats regularly or is part of a recurring sequence to enable conditional rendering, editing, or deleting of individual occurrences versus the entire series, manage exceptions within repeating events, and distinguish between master events and single instances for accurate updates and display logic. This functionality helps detect recurring patterns, control recurrence rules, identify series membership, and implement logic for repeat event handling, series exception management, and event recurrence verification in calendar or scheduling applications.
</div>

#### Returns

`Boolean` return `true` if event is recurring.

#### Example - check whether an event is an occurrence

    <script>
        var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({
            id: 0,
            recurrenceId: 1, //id of the recurrence head event
            title: "Task1",

    </script>

### isRecurrenceHead

Checks whether the event is the head of a recurring series.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Check if a calendar or scheduling event is the primary or main instance of a recurring pattern, identify the master occurrence in a series to distinguish between the initial event and its repetitions, determine whether an event triggers updates or deletions for the whole recurring series versus just one occurrence or an exception, enable differentiation between the original repeated meeting and its exceptions, configure logic to handle recurring event heads, detect if an event controls the entire series for modifications, find out whether the event is the starting point in repeated event chains, decide on editing rules for single or multiple occurrences, and manage recurring schedules by confirming if an event serves as the anchor or primary event in a recurrence sequence.
</div>

#### Returns

`Boolean` return `true` if event is a recurrence head.

#### Example - check whether an event is a recurrence head

    <script>
        var event = new kendo.data.SchedulerEvent({

        console.log(event.isRecurrenceHead()); //logs 'true'
    </script>

### toOccurrence

Converts the scheduler event to a event occurrence. Method will remove `recurrenceRule`, `recurrenceException` options, will add a `recurrenceId` field and will set `id` to the default one.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Convert recurring calendar events into individual single event instances for editing, updating, saving, or sending by extracting a specific occurrence from a repeating series. Enable transforming complex recurring events into standalone occurrences with unique identifiers, removing recurrence rules and exceptions while preserving a reference to the original series, allowing developers to manage exceptions, customize single event edits, serialize occurrences independently, and handle updates without affecting the whole recurring pattern. Control and manipulate individual event instances derived from multi-occurrence schedules for flexible calendar event modification, binding, or persistence in scheduling applications.
</div>

#### Parameters

##### options `Object`

Additional options passed to the SchedulerEvent constructor.

> `uid` property of the event will be preserved.

#### Returns

`kendo.data.SchedulerEvent` the occurrence.
