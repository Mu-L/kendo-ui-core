# kendo.ui.Stepper

Represents the Kendo UI Stepper widget. Inherits from [Widget](/api/javascript/ui/widget).

## Configuration

### indicator `Boolean` *(default: true)*

Indicates whether the Steps in the **Stepper** will render their indicator element (the icon or number placed in a circle above the Step label).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure whether to show or hide the step indicator icons or numeric badges above each step label in a multi-step navigation or progress component, controlling the visibility of circle icons, step numbers, visual markers, or labels that represent the current step status, enabling disabling or toggling these indicators for step navigation bars, progress trackers, or wizard-style user interfaces during setup or runtime.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            indicator: false,
            steps: ["Initial step", "Second step", "Third step"]
        });
	</script>

### label `Boolean` *(default: true)*

Indicates whether the Steps in the **Stepper** will render their label element (the text placed below the Step indicator circle).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure the display of step labels beneath step indicators, toggle visibility of step titles or captions, enable or disable showing descriptive text for each progress point or milestone, control label rendering in multi-step navigation or form steps, adjust whether step names appear under circles or markers in a sequence, manage visibility of step annotations or identifiers in step-based workflows, customize showing or hiding textual step indicators below step icons, set presentation of labels in step progress components for clarity or minimalism, control labeling features to enhance user guidance in sequential UI elements.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            label: false,
            steps: ["Initial step", "Second step", "Third step"]
        });
	</script>

### linear `Boolean` *(default: true)*

Indicates whether the **Stepper** will force the user to follow the Steps sequence or not. If set to "false" it will allow the user to select any step. If in its default state ("true") the user will be able to select the step immediately after the currently selected step or the previous step.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure whether a step-by-step process enforces strict sequential navigation or allows free movement between steps, controlling if users can jump directly to any step or must proceed in order. Set or toggle linear progression to require moving through steps one by one without skipping ahead, or disable linear mode to enable random access to any step at any time. Control navigation flow in multi-step interfaces, enabling step locking, sequential progression, or free step selection for workflows that need ordered completion versus flexible step jumps. Manage stepper navigation behavior to enforce step dependencies, restrict skipping steps, or allow non-linear step selection and direct step access in step-based forms and wizards.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            linear: false,
            steps: ["Initial step", "Second step", "Third step"]
        });
	</script>

### orientation `String` *(default: "horizontal")*

Indicates whether the **Stepper** will be rendered vertically or horizontally (default).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control the direction or layout flow of a multi-step user interface component by setting its orientation to vertical or horizontal, enabling customization of step arrangement, visual stacking, and navigation flow to suit different design patterns, UX preferences, or screen layouts, including toggling between vertical columns or horizontal rows for progress indicators, stepper navigation, or wizard-like interfaces; set or configure the flow direction to optimize user experience, responsiveness, or visual grouping in multi-step forms, progress tracking, or guided workflows.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper" style="height: 600px"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            orientation: "vertical",
            steps: ["Initial step", "Second step", "Third step"]
        });
	</script>

### selectOnFocus `Boolean` *(default: false)*

Applicable for scenarios when keyboard is used for navigation. Indicates whether the selection will change upon focus change or it will require additional action (Enter or Spacebar key press) in order to select the focused step.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control whether keyboard navigation in a stepper component automatically updates the current active step upon focusing a new step or if users must explicitly confirm selection with keys like Enter or Spacebar; configure immediate selection as focus moves or require manual activation for changing steps during keyboard-only interaction, enabling customization of keyboard usability, accessibility behavior, and step navigation control to suit various input workflows and user preferences for step selection and focus handling.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>
    <p>Use the keyboard arrow keys to change selected step.</p>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            selectOnFocus: true,
            steps: ["Initial step", "Second step", "Third step"]
        });
	</script>

### steps `Array`

Array of steps to be rendered in the **Stepper**. If the array contains objects, their fields will be used for each Step. If the array contains strings, those will be used as Step labels.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Configure the order and titles of steps in a multi-step process by setting a list or array of step definitions, which can be simple labels as strings or detailed objects specifying each step's title and metadata, enabling you to control and customize the progression, sequence, and display of step indicators in workflows, wizards, or progress trackers.
</div>

#### Example - steps defined as array of strings

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: ["Initial step", "Second step", "Third step"]
        });
	</script>

#### Example - steps defined as array of objects

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step"
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }]
        });
	</script>

### steps.enabled `Boolean` *(default: true)*

Defines whether the Step is enabled or not. By default all steps are enabled.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control the activation state of individual steps within a multi-step navigation or form wizard by enabling or disabling specific steps to manage user access, interaction, focus, or navigation flow; configure which steps are accessible or locked, allowing you to set active or inactive stages, prevent skipping, restrict progression, or toggle step availability dynamically during initialization or runtime, to customize user journeys, guide workflow, or implement conditional step activation in step-based interfaces.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step",
                enabled: false
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }]
        });
	</script>

### steps.error `Boolean` *(default: false)*

Defines whether the Step is in error state (is invalid). By default all steps are valid.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and configure the invalid or error state of individual steps in a multi-step process or wizard by enabling or disabling error flags that mark steps as failed validation, invalid, or requiring user attention, affecting both validation logic and visual error indicators; set or update boolean error statuses dynamically during initialization or runtime to highlight steps with issues, failed checks, input mistakes, or incomplete information, allowing developers to manage step validity, display error styles, control workflow progression based on step correctness, and indicate which steps need fixing or review.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step",
                error: true
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }]
        });
	</script>

### steps.icon `String`

Defines a name of an existing icon in the Kendo UI theme sprite. The icon will be displayed in the indicator element of that Step.
For a list of available icon names, please refer to the [Web Font Icons article](https://docs.telerik.com/kendo-ui/styles-and-layout/icons-web).


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set or customize the icon displayed inside a step indicator by configuring the stepâ€™s icon name from the available themed icon sprite or web font icons, enabling you to control which symbol or graphic appears within the step marker, adjust visual cues for progress steps, or integrate specific icons representing step status, type, or action in workflows and navigation components.
</div>

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step",
                icon: "cancel"
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }]
        });
	</script>

### steps.iconTemplate `String|Function`

The [template](/api/javascript/kendo/methods/template) used to render the icon in the indicator of the step.

The fields which can be used in the template are:

* label `String` - the label set on the step
* icon `String` - the icon specified for this step (if any)
* successIcon `String` - the successIcon specified for this step (if any)
* enabled `Boolean` - indicates whether the step is enabled (true) or disabled (false)

* selected `Boolean` - indicates whether the step is selected
* previous `Boolean` - indicates whether the step is before the currently selected or not
* index `Number` - a zero-based index of the current step
* isFirstStep `Boolean` - indicates whether the step is the initial one in the Stepper
* isLastStep `Boolean` - indicates whether the step is the last one in the Stepper
* indicatorVisible `Boolean` - indicates whether the indicator, which holds the icon should be displayed or not
* labelVisible `Boolean` - indicates whether the label section of the step should be displayed or not


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control and customize the rendering of step indicator icons in multi-step navigation components by defining templates that dynamically generate icon markup based on step properties such as label text, custom icons, success icons, and states including enabled or disabled, error presence, selection status, and step position indicators like first or last step. Enable flexible icon display and styling that reacts to step metadata, selection sequence, visibility toggles for icons and labels, and index order to tailor step indicators according to application workflow, user progress tracking, error highlighting, and UI consistency preferences. Support scenarios involving custom icon binding, conditional rendering based on step state, and adaptive UI elements for user onboarding, process flows, and wizard-style navigation interfaces.
</div>

#### Example - Use a string template

    <nav id="stepper"></nav>

	<script>
        $("#stepper").kendoStepper({

Returns the Step Array configured in the Stepper. If used with an Array parameter, alters the steps in the widget according to the passed configuration of the steps.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Access or modify the sequence of steps in a multi-step interface, retrieve the current array of step definitions or provide a new set to dynamically change step order, labels, properties, or configuration in a stepper control. Adjust the workflow steps programmatically, update step metadata, control progression stages, configure step names or details, reset or replace existing steps, and fetch the active list of step settings to customize the user flow and stepper behavior within an application.
</div>

#### Parameters

##### steps `Array` *optional*

Array of steps to be rendered in the **Stepper**.

#### Returns `Array`

`Array[Step]` The [Step](/api/javascript/stepper/step) instances available in the **Stepper** widget.

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper" style="height:400px"></nav>

	<script>
        var stepper = $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step"
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }]
        }).getKendoStepper();

		stepper.steps([{
            label: "Reset 1"
        },{
            label: "Reset 2",
            selected: true
        }]);
	</script>

## Events

### activate

Fires when a new Step has been selected upon user interaction.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Detect or handle changes in the stepper component when a user selects a different step through clicking, touching, or keyboard input by capturing activation events that signal a step switch. Enable event listeners or callbacks to trigger actions such as loading new content, validating user input, updating application state, progressing to the next stage, or navigating through multi-step workflows upon user-driven step selections. Monitor and respond to step activation signals for dynamic step transitions and interactive stepper control, ensuring responsive UI updates or business logic execution whenever users move between steps.
</div>

#### Event Data

##### e.originalEvent `Object`

The original DOM event.

##### e.sender `kendo.ui.Stepper`

The **Stepper** instance that triggered the event.

##### e.step `kendo.stepper.Step`

The [Step](/api/javascript/stepper/step) instance that has been selected.

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper" style="height:400px"></nav>

	<script>
        var stepper = $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step"
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }],
            activate: function(e) {
	/* The result can be observed in the DevTools(F12) console of the browser. */
                console.log(e.step);
            }
        });
	</script>

### select

Fires when the user clicks on a Step to select it.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Capture user interactions when a specific step or stage is chosen within a multi-step process or wizard by detecting clicks or selections on individual steps, enabling the execution of custom code, triggering navigation changes, synchronizing UI components, updating application state, or handling step transitions based on user input or programmatic control. This event supports monitoring which step is active or selected, allowing developers to respond to step changes, manage flow control, implement step validation triggers, or coordinate progress indicators and dynamic content updates during step selection.
</div>

#### Event Data

##### e.originalEvent `Object`

The original DOM event.

##### e.sender `kendo.ui.Stepper`

The **Stepper** instance that triggered the event.

##### e.step `kendo.stepper.Step`

The [Step](/api/javascript/stepper/step) instance that is about to be selected.

##### e.preventDefault `Function`

If invoked prevents the selection.

#### Example

	<nav id="stepper" style="height:400px"></nav>

	<script>
        var stepper = $("#stepper").kendoStepper({
            steps: [{
                label: "Initial step"
            }, {
                label: "Second step"
            },{
                label: "Third step"
            }],
            select: function(e) {
                // The Stepper will not allow user selection
                e.preventDefault();
            }
        });
	</script>
