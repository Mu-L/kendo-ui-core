# kendo.ui.Timeline

Represents the Kendo UI Timeline widget. Inherits from [Widget](/api/javascript/ui/widget).

## Configuration

### autoBind `Boolean` *(default: true)*

If set to `false`, the Timeline will not bind to the data source during initialization, i.e. it will not call the [`fetch`](/api/javascript/data/datasource/methods/fetch) method of the [dataSource](/api/javascript/ui/grid/fields/datasource) instance. In such scenarios data binding will occur when the [change](/api/javascript/data/datasource/events/change) event of the
dataSource instance is fired. By default, `autoBind` is set to `true` and the widget will bind to the data source specified in the configuration.

> Setting `autoBind` to `false` is useful when multiple widgets are bound to the same data source. Disabling automatic binding ensures that the shared data source doesn't make more than one request to the remote service.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control automatic data loading and binding behavior during Timeline initialization by enabling or disabling the automatic fetch from the linked data source, managing when and how the Timeline connects to and retrieves data, preventing redundant remote requests when shared data sources are used among multiple components, configuring data binding triggers on data source change events rather than on startup, and customizing initialization data flow to optimize performance by setting whether the component loads data immediately or waits for manual or event-driven binding.
</div>

#### Example - disable automatic binding

    <div id="timeline"></div>
    <script>
    $("#timeline").kendoTimeline({
        autoBind: false,
        dataSource: {
            data:[ {"id":1,"title":"Bowling tournament","subtitle":"Location: Sterling Lanes","description":"Summer Bowling tournament in Michigan","date":"2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z","actions":[{"text":"Visit the Bowling tournament page"}] },
                    {"id":2,"title":"Charlie's first football game","subtitle":"Location: City Football Stadium","description":"Call coach Williams","date":"2022-10-22T21:00:00.000Z"},
                    {"id":3,"title":"Alex's Birthday","subtitle":"Location: Alex's House","description":"Buy birthday cake and some fruits","date":"2010-01-09T22:00:00.000Z","images":[{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/4.jpg"},{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/16.jpg"}]},
                    {"id":4,"title":"Vacation in Mexico","subtitle": "Location: Cabo San Lucas","description":"Check-in for the flight","date":"2017-12-24T22:00:00.000Z"}],
            schema: {
                model: {
                    fields: {
                        date: {
                        type: "date"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        alternatingMode: true,
        orientation: "horizontal"
    });
    </script>

### alternatingMode `Boolean`*(default: false)*

Indicates whether events should be positioned on both sides of the timeline axis. By default all events are displayed on the right side of the timeline axis.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control the layout of timeline events by enabling or configuring alternate side placement so that events appear on both the left and right sides of the axis for improved visual distinction, side-by-side positioning, staggered chronological displays, or balanced event alignment. Adjust the positioning mode to switch between single-sided stacking and alternating arrangement along the timeline axis, supporting use cases that require symmetric event distribution, clearer event separation, or enhanced timeline readability where events need to be offset on opposing sides. Toggle this setting to enable dual-sided timeline event placement for a more dynamic, zigzag, or staggered visual presentation of sequential or parallel events, improving the clarity and aesthetic flow of time-based data.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="timeline"></div>

    <script>

    $("#timeline").kendoTimeline({
        dataSource: {
            data:[ {"id":1,"title":"Bowling tournament","subtitle":"Location: Sterling Lanes","description":"Summer Bowling tournament in Michigan","date":"2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z","actions":[{"text":"Visit the Bowling tournament page"}] },
                    {"id":2,"title":"Charlie's first football game","subtitle":"Location: City Football Stadium","description":"Call coach Williams","date":"2022-10-22T21:00:00.000Z"},
                    {"id":3,"title":"Alex's Birthday","subtitle":"Location: Alex's House","description":"Buy birthday cake and some fruits","date":"2010-01-09T22:00:00.000Z","images":[{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/4.jpg"},{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/16.jpg"}]},
                    {"id":4,"title":"Vacation in Mexico","subtitle": "Location: Cabo San Lucas","description":"Check-in for the flight","date":"2017-12-24T22:00:00.000Z"}],
            schema: {
                model: {
                fields: {
                    date: {
                    type: "date"
                    }
                }
                }
            }
        },
        alternatingMode: true,
        orientation: "vertical"
    });
    </script>

### orientation `String`*(default: "vertical")*

Sets the orienation of the timeline axis. The widget expects "horizontal" or "vertical"


<div class="meta-api-description">
Set, control, or configure the direction and layout of a timeline or sequence axis to display events, tasks, or items horizontally or vertically. Adjust the orientation to switch between horizontal and vertical layouts when rendering timeline components, enabling customization of event flow direction for better visualization. Enable users to specify axis alignment, direction, or layout style for sequential data display along the horizontal or vertical plane, supporting use cases like horizontal scrolling timelines or vertical chronological event stacks. Facilitate orientation switching to change how timeline entries or milestones are arranged visually, helping developers customize the timeline layout dynamically or at initialization.
</div>

#### Example - set the orientation to horizontal

    <div id="timeline"></div>

    <script>

    $("#timeline").kendoTimeline({
        dataSource: {
            data:[ {"id":1,"title":"Bowling tournament","subtitle":"Location: Sterling Lanes","description":"Summer Bowling tournament in Michigan","date":"2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z","actions":[{"text":"Visit the Bowling tournament page"}] },
                    {"id":2,"title":"Charlie's first football game","subtitle":"Location: City Football Stadium","description":"Call coach Williams","date":"2022-10-22T21:00:00.000Z"},
                    {"id":3,"title":"Alex's Birthday","subtitle":"Location: Alex's House","description":"Buy birthday cake and some fruits","date":"2010-01-09T22:00:00.000Z","images":[{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/4.jpg"},{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/16.jpg"}]},
                    {"id":4,"title":"Vacation in Mexico","subtitle": "Location: Cabo San Lucas","description":"Check-in for the flight","date":"2017-12-24T22:00:00.000Z"}],
            schema: {
                model: {
                fields: {
                    date: {
                    type: "date"
                    }
                }
                }
            }
        },
        alternatingMode: true,
        orientation: "horizontal"
    });
    </script>

### collapsibleEvents `Boolean`*(default: false)*

Enables the events in the Kendo UI Timeline to be expandable or collapsible. When enabled initially all events are collapsed.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Enable or disable the ability to expand or collapse individual timeline events, allowing users to toggle visibility of detailed event information, configure initial event states to show only summaries or full details, manage interactive event folding for cleaner views, control whether event items start minimized or fully visible, and set up user-driven expand/collapse functionality to improve timeline readability and navigation.

    </script>

### collapse

Collapse an event.

> This method is supported only in vertical mode.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control how to programmatically hide or minimize expanded timeline events, collapsing detailed views or visual nodes on vertical timelines by invoking a collapse action or method. Enable closing or retracting event expansions triggered by user clicks, code commands, or interactive gestures, specifically managing timeline item visibility, folding, or contraction in vertical layouts while noting that collapsing functionality does not apply or work in horizontal timeline orientations. This supports scenarios where developers need to automate hiding event details, toggle visibility states, or manage timeline event expansions and collapses through code in vertically oriented timeline components.
</div>

#### Parameters

##### event `String | Element | jQuery`

#### Parameters

##### event `String | Element | jQuery`

A string, a DOM element, or a jQuery object which represents the event. A string is treated as a jQuery selector.

#### Example - expand the first event

    <div id="timeline"></div>

    <script>

    $("#timeline").kendoTimeline({
        dataSource: {
            data:[ {"id":1,"title":"Bowling tournament","subtitle":"Location: Sterling Lanes","description":"Summer Bowling tournament in Michigan","date":"2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z","actions":[{"text":"Visit the Bowling tournament page"}] },
                    {"id":2,"title":"Charlie's first football game","subtitle":"Location: City Football Stadium","description":"Call coach Williams","date":"2022-10-22T21:00:00.000Z"},
                    {"id":3,"title":"Alex's Birthday","subtitle":"Location: Alex's House","description":"Buy birthday cake and some fruits","date":"2010-01-09T22:00:00.000Z","images":[{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/4.jpg"},{"src":"https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/content/web/foods/16.jpg"}]},
                    {"id":4,"title":"Vacation in Mexico","subtitle": "Location: Cabo San Lucas","description":"Check-in for the flight","date":"2017-12-24T22:00:00.000Z"}],
            schema: {
                model: {
                fields: {
                    date: {
                    type: "date"
                    }
                }
                }
            }
        },
        orientation: "horizontal"
    });

    var timeline = $("#timeline").data().kendoTimeline;
    var firstEvent = timeline.element.find(".k-timeline-track-item:eq(3)");
    timeline.open(firstEvent);
    </script>

### destroy

Prepares the Timeline for safe removal from the DOM. Detaches all event handlers and removes the `jQuery.data` attributes to avoid memory leaks. Calls the `destroy` method of any child Kendo UI widgets.

> The `destroy` method does not remove the `Timeline` element from the DOM.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control the complete cleanup and disposal process of a timeline component by detaching event listeners, unbinding data attributes to prevent memory leaks, and cascading destruction through child UI elements to fully release resources before manual DOM element removal. Configure teardown routines, enable comprehensive unbinding of event handlers, data detachment, and resource deallocation for timeline-based interfaces, ensuring proper lifecycle management, memory optimization, and preventing memory leaks in complex UI hierarchies. This method is essential for developers needing to programmatically manage and destroy timeline components, trigger cleanup sequences, or implement custom DOM manipulations while maintaining application stability and performance.
</div>

#### Example

    <div id="timeline"></div>

    <script>

    $("#timeline").kendoTimeline({
        dataSource: {
            data:[ {"id":1,"title":"Bowling tournament","subtitle":"Location: Sterling Lanes","description":"Summer Bowling tournament in Michigan","date":"2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z","actions":[{"text":"Visit the Bowling tournament page"}] },

        orientation: "vertical"
    });

    var timeline = $("#timeline").data().kendoTimeline;
    timeline.destroy();
    </script>

### next

Switches to the next portion of events with animation.

> This method is supported only in horizontal mode.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Control or trigger the horizontal timeline navigation by moving to the next set or group of events with smooth animated transitions, enabling programmatic advancement or linking navigation buttons to shift the timeline forward. This method handles advancing to the subsequent visible event segment, supports next-step navigation in horizontal layout only, and ensures seamless scrolling effects when stepping through timeline event groups. Adjust, enable, or automate horizontal timeline progression, skipping forward through event clusters with built-in animation while ignoring vertical orientations.

## Events

### change

Fires when a new event is opened.

> This event is supported only in horizontal mode.


<div class="meta-api-description">
Detect when a user selects, opens, or activates an item on a horizontal timeline to trigger actions like loading event details, updating UI elements, focusing on the chosen entry, synchronizing application state, fetching related data remotely, tracking user interaction patterns, or displaying expanded information panels dynamically when timeline entries change.
</div>

#### Event Data

##### e.sender `kendo.ui.Timeline`

The widget instance which fired the event.

##### e.dataItem `kendo.data.Model`

The data item for the selected event.

##### e.eventContainer `jQuery`

The container element that will load the event details.

##### e.preventDefault `Function`

If invoked, prevents the change action.

#### Example - hooking up to the change event

    <div id="timeline"></div>

    <script>

    $("#timeline").kendoTimeline({
        dataSource: {
            data:[ {"id":1,"title":"Bowling tournament","subtitle":"Location: Sterling Lanes","description":"Summer Bowling tournament in Michigan","date":"2025-06-30T21:00:00.000Z","actions":[{"text":"Visit the Bowling tournament page"}] },
