# Providing Client-Side Resources for {{ site.product }}

This article outlines the approaches for adding the Kendo client-side assets to your application.

The {{ site.product }} suite is a set of server-side wrappers over the <a href="https://www.telerik.com/kendo-jquery-ui" target="_blank">Kendo UI for jQuery client-side widgets</a>. To use the {{ site.product_short }} components in an application, you need not only the [binaries]({% slug downloadinstall_aspnetcore %}) that enable you to use the {% if site.core %}TagHelpers and HtmlHelpers{% else %}HtmlHelpers{% endif %}, but also the required JavaScript and CSS client-side web assets. 

## Available Approaches

You can use the following methods for adding the Kendo client-side resources to your project: 

* Using local files

    You can provide the client-side assets by downloading the required JavaScript and CSS files from the Telerik website and then copying them in your project. For the detailed step-by-step procedure, see the [Using Local Files]({% slug using_local_client_side_resources %}) article.

{% if site.core %}
* Using LibMan

    The LibMan client-side library management tool allows you to fetch the Kendo UI client-side files that are distributed as NPM packages and place them in a folder within your ASP.NET Core project. The scripts in the NPM packages are not usable in the browser. This requires you to use a bundler such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank">WebPack</a>. For the detailed step-by-step procedure, see the [Using LibMan]({% slug using_libman %}) article.
{% endif %}

* Using CDN

    The Kendo UI client-side resources like JavaScript files and CSS files are available online through the Kendo CDN service. This allows you to configure your project to import the client-side resources directly from the CDN. For more details, see the [Using CDN]({% slug cdnservices_core %}) article.

## Creating Custom Script Bundles

Depending on the Telerik UI components that you use in your project, you may need lighter scripts that support only the components in your application. You can create your custom script file that contains the scripts for the required components or use combined scripts. For more details, refer to the [Creating Custom Bundles article]({% slug creating-custom-bundles %}).
