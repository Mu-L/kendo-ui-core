# Frequently Asked Questions

This article lists the answers to the most frequently asked questions (FAQs) about working with the {{ site.product }} license key.

## Does the license key expire?

Yes, the license key expires at the end of your subscription:

* For trial users, this is at the end of your 30-day trial period.
* For commercial license holders, this is when your subscription term expires.

You need to download and install a new license key after:

* Starting a new trial
* Buying a new license
* Renewing an existing license
* Upgrading an existing license

>An expired [perpetual license](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/faq/licensing-purchasing#licensing) key is valid for all {{ site.product }} versions published before the license expiration date.

## Will {{ site.product }} function with an expired license key?

This depends on the [{{ site.product }} license type (perpetual, subscription, or trial)](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/faq/licensing-purchasing#licensing):

* *Perpetual licenses* function normally with an expired license key, as long as the application is using a version that was released before the expiration date of the license.
* *Subscription licenses* function normally in already deployed applications, but you cannot rebuild and republish the app.
* *Trial licenses* function normally only within the 30-day trial period.

Scenarios that do not match the above three descriptions result in the following application behaviors:

* A popup banner appears on application startup.
* A watermark appears on {{ site.product }} components.
* [A warning message appears in the application's build log]({%slug troubleshooting-license-key-errors%}).

## I updated the {{ site.product }} version in my project and license errors appeared. Why?

The most likely cause is that the new {{ site.product }} version was released after the expiration date of your current license or license key. To fix this issue:

1. Renew your {{ site.product }} license, if necessary.
1. [Update your license key]({%slug installation_license_key_aspnetcore%}#license-key-updates)
1. For more details on problems related to the licensing and their solutions, see the [License Key Errors article]({%slug troubleshooting-license-key-errors%}).

## Can I use the same license key in multiple builds?

You can use your personal license key in multiple pipelines, builds, and environments. However, each individual developer must use their own unique personal license key.

## Do I need an Internet connection to activate the license?

No, the license validation and activation occur offline.

## Do I have to add the license key to source control?

No, do not add the `telerik-license.txt` license key file or its contents to source control.

Do not store the license key in plain text in GitHub Actions Workflow definitions. Build servers must use the [`TELERIK_LICENSE` environment variable]({%slug deployment_license_key_aspnetcore%}).

## What happens if both the environment variable and the license key file are present?

If both the `TELERIK_LICENSE` environment variable and the `telerik-license.txt` file are present, then the environment variable will be used.
To use the license key file, unset the environment variable.

## What happens if several license key files exist?

If both a global and a project-specific `telerik-license.txt` files exist, then the project-specific license key will be used.

## My team has more than one license holder. Which key do we have to use?

To activate {{ site.product }} on your development machine, use the key associated with your personal account.

To activate {{ site.product }} in a CI/CD environment, use any of the license keys in your team.

>Every developer must be assigned [their own license or seat](https://www.telerik.com/purchase/faq/licensing-purchasing) and they must use a license key that is associated with their personal Telerik account.

## Are earlier {{ site.product }} versions affected?

No, versions up to **2024.4.1112** released prior to February 2025 do not require a license key. They use an older licsensing mechanism that requires [Referencing a Script Key]({%slug installation_legacy_licensing_aspnetcore%})
