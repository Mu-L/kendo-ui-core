# Export to Excel Server-Side

> The approach demonstrated in this article is now deprecated in favor of the [server-side processing concept]({% slug excelexport_gridhelper_aspnetcore %}#use-server-side-processing).

The following example demonstrates how to export the Kendo UI Grid data as an Excel document by implementing it through the NPOI open-source library as well as the Microsoft OpenXML SDK.

To see an example, refer to the [Grid Server Export demo](https://demos.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc/grid/server-export).
