# Adaptive Mode

The Telerik UI for {{ site.framework }} Pager supports an adaptive mode that provides a mobile-friendly rendering of its [built-in drop-down that allows the user to change the page size]({% slug settings_pager_aspnet%}#settings).

To enable the adaptive rendering mode, set the `AdaptiveMode()` property to `AdaptiveMode.Auto`.

The Pager component automatically adapts to the current screen size and changes the rendering of the drop-down for page size selection accordingly. On medium-sized screens, the options list is displayed as docked to the bottom of the screen, while on smaller screens, it is rendered as a full-screen modal dialog. In all other scenarios, including when the `AdaptiveMode()` option is not specified or is set to its default value ofÂ `AdaptiveMode.None`, the standard popup is rendered docked to the input of the drop-down.

The adaptive mode changes the rendering of the Pager's drop-down element based on the screen resolution of the device (the horizontal value in `px`) with the following breakpoints:

* Small screens&mdash;up to 500 px.
* Medium screens&mdash;between 501 px and 768 px.
* Large screens&mdash;over 768 px.

The following example demonstrates how to enable the adaptive mode of the Pager by using the `AdaptiveMode()` option.
