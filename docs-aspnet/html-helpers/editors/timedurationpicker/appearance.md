The default size value is `medium` and is applied to the wrapping `span` element through the `k-input-md` class.

## Rendering
 
To review the rendering of the component, refer to the HTML specifications in the [Kendo UI Themes Monorepo](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-themes/tree/develop). The `tests` folder of the repository contains the rendering for all flavors of the components, providing a clear reference for how their elements are structured. The rendering information can help you customize a component's appearance and behavior by applying custom CSS or JavaScript to suit specific design or functional requirements.
