# Adaptiveness

Adaptiveness is an advanced capability that enhances the Telerik UI for {{ site.framework }} MultiSelect by enabling a completely new layout based on the screen size. It also allows you to adjust the displayed on-screen keyboard for a more user-friendly interaction on touchscreen devices.

## Adaptive Mode

The MultiSelect supports an adaptive mode that provides a mobile-friendly rendering of its popup. To enable the adaptive rendering mode, set the [`AdaptiveMode()`](/api/kendo.mvc.ui.fluent/multiselectbuilder#adaptivemodekendomvcuiadaptivemode) property to `AdaptiveMode.Auto`.

> Starting with the 2025 Q2 release, when the adaptive rendering mode is enabled and the component is accessed on a mobile device, the popup will open as soon as the component receives focus. In previous versions, the popup only opened once the user began typing.

The MultiSelect component automatically adapts to the current screen size and changes its rendering accordingly. On medium-sized screens, the suggestion list is displayed as docked to the bottom of the screen, while on smaller screens, it is rendered as a full-screen modal dialog. In all other scenarios, including when the `AdaptiveMode()` option is not specified or is set to its default value ofÂ `AdaptiveMode.None`, the standard popup is rendered docked to the input of the component.

The adaptive mode changes the rendering of the MultiSelect popup element based on the screen resolution of the device (the horizontal value in `px`) with the following breakpoints:

* Small screens&mdash;up to 500 px.
* Medium screens&mdash;between 501 px and 768 px.
* Large screens&mdash;over 768 px.

The following example demonstrates how to enable the adaptive mode of the MultiSelect by using the `AdaptiveMode()` option.

## On-Screen Keyboard

To enhance the user experience of your application on mobile devices, you can configure the type of the on-screen keyboard for the MultiSelect component.

To display an on-screen keyboard when the user focuses the MultiSelect input, set the `InputMode()` property to any of the supported <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode#values" target="_blank">`inputmode`</a> HTML attribute values. Based on the defined value, the browser displays the respective virtual keyboard on the screen.

The following example demonstrates how to configure the most appropriate on-screen keyboard for the MultiSelect.

```HtmlHelper
    @(Html.Kendo().MultiSelect()
        .Name("multiSelect")
        .DataTextField("ProductName")
        .DataValueField("ProductID")
        .InputMode("search")
        .DataSource(source =>
        {
            source.Read(read =>
            {
                read.Action("GetProducts", "Home");
            })
            .ServerFiltering(true);
        })
    )
```
{% if site.core %}
```TagHelper
    @addTagHelper *, Kendo.Mvc

    <kendo-multiselect name="multiSelect"
        input-mode="search"
        datatextfield="ProductName"
        datavaluefield="ProductID">
       <datasource type="DataSourceTagHelperType.Custom" server-filtering="true">
           <transport>
                <read url="@Url.Action("GetProducts", "Home")" />
           </transport>
       </datasource>
    </kendo-multiselect>
```
{% endif %}
