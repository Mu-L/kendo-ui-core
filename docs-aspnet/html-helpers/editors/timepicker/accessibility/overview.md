# TimePicker Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} TimePicker provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The TimePicker is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

### TimePicker Wrapping Element

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-input-inner` | `role=combobox` | The input element should follow the `combobox` specification. |
|  | `label for` or `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | The input needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `aria-required=true` | The attribute is rendered only when the TimePicker is in a `form` HTML element and announces the required state of the component. |
|  | `aria-describedby=.k-form-hint id/.k-form-error id` | Points to the hint for the input, or if the input is invalid, to the error message. This attribute should only be present when a hint is set or when the input is invalid. |
|  | `aria-expanded=true/false` | Announces whether the Popup is visible or not. |
|  | `aria-controls=.k-animation-container id` | Points to the popup element. Signifies that the `combobox` element controls the `listbox` popup. |
|  | `readonly` or `aria-readonly` | Attribute is rendered only when the DatePicker is readonly. |
| `.k-invalid .k-input-inner,.ng-invalid .k-input-inner` | `aria-invalid=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the picker is in form and announces the valid state of the component. |
| `.k-disabled .k-input-inner` | `disabled=disabled` or `aria-disabled=true` | Attribute is rendered only when the DatePicker is disabled. |
| `.k-input-button` | `role=button` or `nodeName=button` | The element must either be a `<button>` element or must have `role=button` assigned. |
|  | `aria-label` | The button needs an accessible name to be assigned to it. |
|  | `tabindex=-1` | Button element must not be focusable. |
| `.k-timepicker.k-disabled .k-button` | `disabled` or `aria-disabled` | Attribute is rendered only when the picker is disabled. |

### ListBox Popup

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-animation-container` | `role=region` | When the component container is appended to the `<body>` element of the document, it requires you to assing a `landmark` role to it. Otherwise, append it to an element with an appropriate `landmark` role. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | When the container has a `region` role assigned, povides a label. |
| `.k-list-ul` | `role=listbox` | Identifies the `ul` element as a listbox. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | Provides a label for the listbox of the ComboBox. |
| `.k-list-item` | `role=option` | Identifies the `li` element as a listbox option. |
|  | `id` | When grouped, the list items must have an `id` attribute specified, so that the `aria-owns` attribute of their group header elements (with `role=group`) point to that ids. |
|  | `aria-describedby` | When grouped, the list items must have an `aria-describedby` attribute pointing to the id of the `k-list-item-text` element in their `k-list-group-item`. |
| `.k-list-item.k-selected` | `aria-selected=true` | Indicates the selected state of the item. |
| `.k-list-group-item` | `role=group` | The group elements in the popup list must be have `role=group`. |
|  | `aria-owns` | The group elements in the popup list must own the list items belonging to their group. |
| `.k-list-group-item>.k-list-item-text` | `id` | The `k-list-item-text` elements of the `k-list-group-item` must have an id specified. The `aria-labelledby` attribute of the list items in the group must point to that id. |
