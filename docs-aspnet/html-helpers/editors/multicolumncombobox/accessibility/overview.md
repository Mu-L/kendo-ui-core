# MultiColumnComboBox Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} MultiColumnComboBox provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The MultiColumnComboBox is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The MultiColumnComboBox implements the same ARIA specification as the **ComboBox** component.
