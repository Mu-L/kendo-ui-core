# ImageEditor Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} ImageEditor provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The ImageEditor is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The ImageEditor is a composite component containing:


 - ToolBar (`role=toolbar`);
 - Image canvas (`role=img`);
 - Edit action pane (`role=form`);


The ToolBar follows the spec for the ToolBar component:

[ToolBar accessibility specification]({% slug htmlhelpers_toolbar_accessibility %})


The image canvas must have an appropriate role and accessible name assigned:

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-imageeditor-canvas>canvas` | `role=img` | Indicates the canvas' role as an image. |
|  | `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` | Provides an accessible name for the canvas by describing the image content. |


The Edit pane (present on performing crop and resize of image) follows the spec for the Form component:

[Form accessibility specification]({% slug htmlhelpers_form_accessibility %})
