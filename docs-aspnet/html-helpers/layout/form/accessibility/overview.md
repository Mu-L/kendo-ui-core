# Form Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} Form provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Form is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

### Form Component


The Form component provides a structured way to collect user inputs. It is designed to ensure accessibility and usability for all users, including those with disabilities.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-form` | `role=form` or `nodeName=form` | Omitted if the `<form>` DOM element is used. |

### Input elements


The Form field input element of the component should indicate if it is required and announce any hints or error messages.

## Section 508


The Form is fully compliant with the [Section 508 requirements](http://www.section508.gov/).

## Testing


The Form has been extensively tested automatically with [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) and manually with the most popular screen readers.
