# Window Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} Window provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Window is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-window:not(.k-dialog)` | `role=dialog` | Announces the dialog role of the component. |
|  | `aria-labelledby=.k-window-title id` | Associate the title of the dialog. |
| `.k-overlay + .k-window` | `aria-modal=true` | Announces that the dialog is modal. Attribute is added only when the dialog is modal. |


Action buttons follow the **Button** specification.
