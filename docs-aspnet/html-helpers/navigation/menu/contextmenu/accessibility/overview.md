# ContextMenu Accessibility

Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} ContextMenu provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.

The ContextMenu is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-context-menu` | `role=menu` | The context menu implements the `menu` role. |

Apart from the above, the ContextMenu element must implement the [specification for a vertical Menu component]({% slug htmlhelpers_menu_accessibility%}).
