# Breadcrumb Accessibility





Out of the box, the {{ site.product }} Breadcrumb provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.


The Breadcrumb is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA


This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.


The Breadcrumb component renders the semantic `nav` html element that automatically associated navigation role.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-breadcrumb` | `aria-label=Breadcrumb` | Indicates the type of navigation provided by the `nav` element. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-item .k-breadcrumb-link,.k-breadcrumb-item .k-breadcrumb-root-link` | `role=link` or `nodeName=a` | The breadcrumb item should render either an `<a>` element, or should have `role="link"` assigned. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-last-item .k-breadcrumb-link,.k-breadcrumb-last-item .k-breadcrumb-root-link` | `aria-current=page` | The last breadcrumb item that points to the active page should have `aria-current="page"`. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-last-item .k-breadcrumb-link` | `aria-disabled=true` | Indicates that the last breadcrumb item is disabled. |
| `.k-breadcrumb-delimiter-icon` | `aria-hidden=true` | The breadcrumb delimiter icon should not be accessed through assistive technology. |
