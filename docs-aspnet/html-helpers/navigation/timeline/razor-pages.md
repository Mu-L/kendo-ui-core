# Timeline in Razor Pages

Razor Pages is an alternative to the MVC pattern that makes page-focused coding easier and more productive. This approach consists of a `cshtml` file and a `cshtml.cs` file (by design, the two files have the same name). 

You can seamlessly integrate the Telerik UI Timeline for {{ site.framework }} in Razor Pages applications.

This article describes how to configure the Timeline component in a Razor Pages scenario.

For the complete project, refer to the [Timeline in Razor Pages example](https://github.com/telerik/ui-for-aspnet-core-examples/blob/master/Telerik.Examples.RazorPages/Telerik.Examples.RazorPages/Pages/Timeline/TimelineBinding.cshtml).

## Getting Started

To connect the Timeline to a data set retrieved from a remote endpoint in a Razor Pages application, proceed with the following steps:

1. Specify the Read request URL in the `DataSource` configuration. The URL must refer to the method name in the `PageModel`.

    ```HtmlHelper
        .DataSource(dt => dt
            .Read(r=>r.Url("/Timeline/TimelineBinding?handler=Events"))
        )
    ```
    {% if site.core %}
    ```TagHelper
        <datasource>
            <transport>
                <read url="/Timeline/TimelineBinding?handler=Events" />
            </transport>
        </datasource>
    ```
    {% endif %}

1. Within the `cshtml.cs` file, add a handler method for the Read operation that returns the dataset:


    ```C#
        public JsonResult OnGetEvents()
        {
            return new JsonResult(Events);
        }
    ```

1. Populate the `Events` collection in the `OnGet` handler:
```C#
     public static IList<TimelineEventModel> Events;
     
      public void OnGet()

        {
            if (Events == null)
            {
                Events = new List<TimelineEventModel>();

                Events.Add(new TimelineEventModel()
                {
                    Title = "Barcelona \u0026 Tenerife",

Make your way up to the roof for more architectural surprises. And if you like Casa Mila, you’ll want to see another one of Antoni Gaudi’s architectural masterpieces, Casa Batllo, which is located at the center of Barcelona.\r\nTenerife, one of the nearby Canary Islands, is the perfect escape once you’ve had your fill of the city.
